I am particularly skilled in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to innovate. My work is dedicated to improving patient outcomes and enhancing operational efficiency within clinical settings through actionable, data-driven insights.

Education and Academic Excellence
My academic journey is marked by a consistent record of high achievement and a commitment to continuous learning.

Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics (Part-time, Expected Dec 2027)

University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), Little Rock, AR

My current research focuses on leveraging large-scale healthcare data (including Epic Cosmos) to build predictive models and clinical decision support tools.

Master of Science in Information Science (May 2023)

University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR), Little Rock, AR

Graduated with an outstanding CGPA of 3.90/4.00.

Recipient of the "Outstanding Graduate Student" (2022-2023) and "Outstanding Masters Student" (2021-2022) awards.

Graduate Certificate in Data Science (May 2023)

University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR), Little Rock, AR

Achieved a perfect CGPA of 4.00/4.00, demonstrating specialized expertise in database architecture, data privacy, and visualization.

B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering (Oct 2019)

Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), Bangladesh

Graduated with a CGPA of 3.54/4.00.

Received scholarships in every semester for academic excellence.

Professional and Research Experience
I have over four years of professional experience, applying my skills in diverse and challenging environments.

Intermediate Data Analyst | Institute for Digital Health and Innovation, UAMS (June 2023 - Present)

I design and deploy ML-powered clinical decision support tools, notably improving patient risk stratification (AUC-ROC: 0.76, F1-score: 0.88).

I engineer predictive models using Gradient Boosting on large Veterans Health Administration (VHA) datasets to identify patients at high risk of opioid misuse and treatment dropout. This work has contributed to a measurable reduction in opioid-related emergency visits.

I collaborate with clinical, operational, and HR teams to develop capacity forecasting models, optimizing workforce allocation.

My work on evaluating telehealth's impact on Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) outcomes using Epic Cosmos data from ~180k patients showed that telehealth modestly reduced ED visits and slightly increased medication receipt, supporting its continued use.

Data Scientist & Research Assistant | COSMOS Research Center, UALR (Aug 2021 - May 2023)

I developed an NLP-based toxicity classification model with 83% accuracy for real-time content moderation.

I mined and analyzed over 2 million Reddit posts using the Pushshift API to study online toxicity and community dynamics, presenting these findings at international conferences.

Electrical Data Analyst | Renata Limited (Nov 2019 - July 2021)

I led predictive maintenance projects that resulted in a 20% reduction in equipment downtime.

I supervised a team of over 30 engineers to optimize HVAC systems, which boosted energy efficiency and cut operational costs.
